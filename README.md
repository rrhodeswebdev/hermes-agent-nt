# Hermes × NinjaTrader 8 Trading Agent

An automated futures trading agent that streams **NinjaTrader 8** chart data to the
**Claude CLI** (Claude Code in headless print mode, on your subscription — no API key),
which reasons about the market using **order flow + price action**, trades on a
**simulated account** with hard **risk management** and a **daily goal**, and runs a
**self-improving loop** that learns from every closed trade.

> The brain is *configured, not coded*: its trading knowledge, risk rules, and daily goal
> live in **context files** (`hermes/context/`) loaded verbatim into the system prompt.
> **The strategy itself is toggleable** (NinjaTrader's `UseAgentStrategies`): the agent
> can **author its own playbook** from the chart's history (default), or trade **your
> own** playbooks under `hermes/context/strategies/`. The brain is selectable in
> `config/trading.yaml` (`agent.client: mock | claude`): **`claude`** (default — your
> subscription, no API key) or **`mock`** (deterministic rules, no LLM). A Python
> **bridge** sits between NinjaTrader and the brain and is the single, server-side
> **safety authority** that actually places every order — identically in both strategy
> modes.

NinjaTrader 8  ──bars──▶  hermes-bridge  ──asks──▶  Decision brain
(NinjaScript C#)          (Python, risk gate)        (claude | mock)
       ▲                         │   ▲                 + trading context files
       └──── approved orders ◀────┘   └──── every order re-checked by the risk gate
```

## What it does

- **History on start, then every closed bar.** The NinjaScript strategy bulk-uploads all
  loaded bars, then streams each newly closed bar.
- **Decides enter / wait / exit** each bar — via the LLM (Claude) or a deterministic
  rules engine (mock), selectable in config.
- **Auto-executes on the Sim account** with a resting stop/target bracket.
- **Knows its strategy, risk, and daily goal** — defined in editable context files and
  enforced server-side.

## Start everything (Mac side)

```bash
./start.sh          # the single command: brings up the whole Mac side
```

`start.sh` reads `config/trading.yaml`, creates the bridge venv on first run, validates the
configured brain (`mock` or `claude`), waits until the bridge is healthy, prints exactly
what to plug into NinjaTrader (host, `BridgePort`, `StrategyId`), then streams the logs.
**Ctrl-C** stops it cleanly. You start the **NinjaTrader** side yourself (compile + enable
`HermesBridgeStrategy` on a Sim chart).

```bash
./start.sh --mock          # force the deterministic brain (no LLM)
./start.sh --check-claude  # also do a live `claude -p` ping before serving
```

## Start everything (Windows side)

NinjaTrader 8 is Windows-only; the bridge is plain Python, so run both on one box and
talk over `127.0.0.1`. The decision brain is **Claude** via the `claude` CLI on your
subscription — no Anthropic API key, no per-token billing.

```powershell
.\start.ps1                 # bring up the bridge using config/trading.yaml
.\start.ps1 -CheckClaude    # also ping Claude once (one real call) before serving
.\start.ps1 -Mock           # deterministic mock brain (no LLM)
```

Requires [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and Claude Code (`claude` on PATH). The
trading brain is selected by `agent.client: claude` in `config/trading.yaml`; the trading
knowledge stays in `hermes/context/*.md`. Decisions run ~25–35s on Sonnet with full
context, so 2–3m bars (or `model: haiku`) give more headroom than 1m.

**Self-improving loop:** every closed trade is journaled (`bridge/state/journal.jsonl`) and
triggers a background reflection that distils lessons into `hermes/learned/` (local to each
checkout — gitignored; every overwrite keeps a timestamped backup under
`hermes/learned/.history/`, so you can watch — and revert — what it learns). Reflection never
rewrites your hand-written `trader-profile.md`: profile changes land as
`trader-profile.proposed.md` for you to review. Decisions are fed your profile, the agent's
notes, active lessons, and the most similar past trades. `agent.prefilter: mock` cuts Claude
calls by screening entries with the rules first.

## Quick start (no LLM, no NinjaTrader)

```bash
make setup          # create the bridge venv + install
make test           # 91 tests
make replay         # offline mock replay: full enter→manage→exit→daily-goal loop
```

> ℹ️ `make replay` forces the deterministic **mock** brain so the demo stays offline. To
> replay *through Claude* (one live model call per bar):
> `hermes-bridge replay replay/sample_bars.csv --agent claude --config ../config/trading.yaml`

Then follow **`docs/SETUP.md`** to install the Claude CLI and connect NinjaTrader on Sim.

## Safety first

Sim-first by design. Every order passes a server-side **RiskGate**; the daily goal
auto-flattens and halts; a kill switch is one request away; live trading is gated behind
explicit flags. **Read `docs/SAFETY.md` before going near real money.** This is software,
not financial advice.

## Status

- ✅ Bridge: implemented, `ruff` clean, **91/91 tests pass**, replay loop verified.
- ✅ NinjaScript strategy: written to the NT8 API (compile inside NinjaTrader).
- ✅ Decision brain: the `claude` CLI on your subscription, guided by the
  `hermes/context/` files (loaded verbatim into the system prompt).
- ▶️ Next: define *your* exact strategy in `hermes/context/strategy.md` and validate on
  Sim across many sessions.
